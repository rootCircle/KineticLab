# KineticLab
A simple physical demonstration of ball colliding with walls and responding to various parameters

## Introduction
This program just shows a rigid ball respond to various physical parameter including force, drag etc. Values used are arbitrary.

## Known Bugs
Due to probably some end digit approximation or something, a freely bouncing ball under no effect of external force will stick to base after sometime.(I don't know the exact reason to be honest!)

## About project
This project is a compilation of the few projects I made while stepping my foot in GUI programming 3~4 years back. Entire project is written in Processing JAVA.
One can find more info about that language [here](https://www.processing.org).

## How to Run
You will need a PDE to run this code and/or to compile it to distribute it. It is as simple installing Chrome after installing your Windows.
You can get PDE [here](https://www.processing.org/download).

## Credits
I drew heavy inspiration from the project "Bouncing Balls" by Daniel Shiffman. One can find this projects in Examples>Topics>Simulate>Vectors in PDE.
